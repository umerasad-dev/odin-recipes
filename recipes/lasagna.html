          <strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell
          peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and
          crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great
          depth of flavor.

            >Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses
            ready.</strong
          >
          We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesanâ€”like the mix of
          tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> From there, it's just an assembly job. </strong> A cup of
          meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of
          cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the
          ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong>
